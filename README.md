    V. Isualize has given us a assignment. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we need to submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Results:
    After we cteated the summary data frame, as we can see the total rides for each city type of rides, the Urban rides it's the highest number 1,625 and total drivers 2,405 drivers and total fares about $40,000 and it looks Rural rides the lowest total rides 125 and total number of drivers 490 and total fares $4,327 and the following chart has more details and statistics including the average fare per ride and per driver.
