# PyBer_Analysis

Overview:
    The CEO of Pyber company has given us a assignment. Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.     then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we need to submit a written report     that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Results:
    After we created the summary data frame, as we can see the total rides for each city type of rides as the following: 
    The Urban rides the highest number with 1,625, total drivers 2,405 drivers and total fares about $40,000.
    The Suburban rides in the middle with 625 rides, 490 total drivers and $19,356. 
    The Rural rides the lowest total rides with 125, total number of drivers 78 and total fares $4,327.
    the following table and chart have more details and statistics including the average fare per ride and per driver.

Summary: form the analysis that we did, the Urban city type is performing good and the highest and it makes the main revenue for the company,
         so my recommendation is trying to keep on the same level, and about the Suburban and Rural, they should try to invest more in both types by encourage more                drivers to get more revenues from theses city types.
